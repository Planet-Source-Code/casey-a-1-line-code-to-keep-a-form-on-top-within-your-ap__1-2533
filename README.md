## a 1 line code to keep a form on top within your ap


</div>

### Description

The purpose of this extremely small code is to take a form within your application and keep it on top of all the forms within your application. (Modal Forms) Note however that when you use this code, it will make all other forms in your application inaccessible until that form is closed. This is great for times when you have a form like starting a new game, or a form that tells about your program that you want to stay on top and "stop" your program until it is closed.
